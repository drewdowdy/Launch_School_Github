Benefits of OOP

- Relationships between objects are clearer.
- Allows programmers to abstract their ideas.
- Prevents 'spaghetti code' and allows programmers to change any one part of a code without it affecting other parts
- Prevents unecessary repetition and keeps code DRY. (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)
