# Using the code from the previous exercise, create an instance of Cat and assign it to a variable named kitty.

# Initialize a variable `kitty` to reference a new instance of `Cat` by using the `::new` class method on the class.

# Note: `::` is used for class methods while `#` is used for instance methods ([Ruby Documentation](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/preparations#readingdocumentation))
